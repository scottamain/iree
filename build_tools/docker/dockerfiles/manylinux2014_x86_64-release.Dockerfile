# This is derived from a stock manylinux2014 image, based on CentOS 7.
# It does not derive from any of our other images and contains sufficient
# software to build release packages for that OS. Note that the upstream
# images are patched regularly with backports from RedHat and have relatively
# recent dev tooling and Python versions. Bump the base hash to get Python
# and dev tooling upgrades.

# This line of images is EOL on June 30, 2024. Prior to that, we should upgrade
# to a newer revision. Newer manylinux images are based on Debian.

######## GIT CONFIGURATION ########
# Git started enforcing strict user checking, which thwarts version
# configuration scripts in a docker image where the tree was checked
# out by the host and mapped in. Disable the check.
# See: https://github.com/iree-org/iree/issues/12046
# We use the wildcard option to disable the checks. This was added
# in git 2.35.3
